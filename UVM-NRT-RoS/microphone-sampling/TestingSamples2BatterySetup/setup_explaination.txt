The device that all sounds were captured on had 2 batteries.
The first one is to power the Mayfly and the second one is to power the microphone.
The separation was aimed to reduce buzzing noise seen in the previous collected samples.

Below is an explination as to how all samples were collected.
hail_heavy: simulated using rice to mirror larger hail
hail_light: simulated using salt to mirror smaller hail
rain_heavy: jar with holes cut in the top to create the sound of constaint rain, and
a squirt bottle to create dropplets with more force.
rain_med: only used the jar with holes cut in the top to supply a steady stream of water dropplets.
rain_light: used a dropper mechanism to create smaller rain dropplets. May have been too light, 
resulting in not to much sound being picked up from the microphone.
snow: used spices like parsley and cayenne. Similar to rain_light, does not sound like anything
in the recordings due to how light it is and the sensitivity of the microphone
whitenoise: audio collected without anything being poured onto the cone.
