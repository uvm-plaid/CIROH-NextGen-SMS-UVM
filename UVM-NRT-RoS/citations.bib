ABSTRACT = {Environmental sound classification is an important branch of acoustic signal processing. In this work, a set of sound classification features based on audio signal perception and statistical analysis are proposed to describe the signal from multiple aspects of the time and frequency domain. Energy features, spectral entropy features, zero crossing rate (ZCR), and mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) are combined to form joint signal analysis (JSA) features to improve the signal expression of the features. Then, based on the JSA, a novel region joint signal analysis feature (RJSA) for environment sound classification is also proposed. It can reduce feature extraction computation and improve feature stability, robustness, and classification accuracy. Finally, a sound classification framework based on the boosting ensemble learning method is provided to improve the classification accuracy and model generalization. The experimental results show that compared with the highest classification accuracy of the baseline algorithm, the environmental sound classification algorithm based on our proposed RJSA features and ensemble learning methods improves the classification accuracy, and the accuracy of the LightGBM-based sound classification algorithm improves by 14.6%.},

abstract={Environmental sound classification is one of the important issues in the audio recognition field. Compared with structured sounds such as speech and music, the time--frequency structure of environmental sounds is more complicated. In order to learn time and frequency features from Log-Mel spectrogram more effectively, a temporal-frequency attention based convolutional neural network model (TFCNN) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an experiment that is used as motivation in proposed method is designed to verify the effect of a specific frequency band in the spectrogram on model classification. Secondly, two new attention mechanisms, temporal attention mechanism and frequency attention mechanism, are proposed. These mechanisms can focus on key frequency bands and semantic related time frames on the spectrogram to reduce the influence of background noise and irrelevant frequency bands. Then, a feature information complementarity is formed by combining these mechanisms to more accurately capture the critical time--frequency features. In such a way, the representation ability of the network model can be greatly improved. Finally, experiments on two public data sets, UrbanSound 8 K and ESC-50, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

ABSTRACT = {Precipitation in any form—such as rain, snow, and hail—can affect day-to-day outdoor activities. Rainfall prediction is one of the challenging tasks in weather forecasting process. Accurate rainfall prediction is now more difficult than before due to the extreme climate variations. Machine learning techniques can predict rainfall by extracting hidden patterns from historical weather data. Selection of an appropriate classification technique for prediction is a difficult job. This research proposes a novel real-time rainfall prediction system for smart cities using a machine learning fusion technique. The proposed framework uses four widely used supervised machine learning techniques, i.e., decision tree, Naïve Bayes, K-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines. For effective prediction of rainfall, the technique of fuzzy logic is incorporated in the framework to integrate the predictive accuracies of the machine learning techniques, also known as fusion. For prediction, 12 years of historical weather data (2005 to 2017) for the city of Lahore is considered. Pre-processing tasks such as cleaning and normalization were performed on the dataset before the classification process. The results reflect that the proposed machine learning fusion-based framework outperforms other models.},
