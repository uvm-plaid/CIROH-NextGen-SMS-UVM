**Installing TensorFlow Lite onto IDE:**

Arduino no longer supports TensorFlow Lite. Link to download the source files from GitHub: https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro-arduino-examples/tree/main

* Download the repository as a .zip, then go to Arduino IDE and go to Sketch > Include Libraries > Add .zip, and restart the IDE.

Arduino is missing files from the C++ Standard Library, so we are downloading additional GitHub files for these libraries.
