### TODOS:
- Improve the code that works with the Giga to connect to the SWARM -> turn it into an API.
- Try and Get WiFi Shield with Mayfly to work.
  
### SWARM:
- Website for Tracking Sattelite Passes: https://kube.tools.swarm.space/pass-checker/
- HIVE Database: https://bumblebee.hive.swarm.space/
  - Hive credentials (uname/passwd/email): wintersmind/UVM4ever/ceskalka@uvm.edu
- Device documentation: https://swarm.space/documentation-swarm/
- ReST API documentation: https://swarm.space/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Swarm-Hive-API-Integration-Guide.pdf

### Mayfly Notes:
- To get the wifi status lights to work, you need to have SJ17 and SJ16 soldered.
- If we want to have constant power supplied to the Wi-FiBee module, we should also have SJ18 soldered.
- Will need to pass all commands to the mayfly

### Wifi Bee:
- Suggested library by Mayfly makers to use with WiFi Bee: https://github.com/EnviroDIY/TinyGSM/blob/master/README.md
- Wiki for setting up Wifi Bee: https://wiki.dfrobot.com/SKU_TEL0092_WiFi_Bee-ESP8266_Wirelss_module
